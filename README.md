# Install Instructions
If you aren't already following the instructions from the docs, open the [EasySpark Docs](https://frc-6026.gitbook.io/easyspark).
 1. Go to the source code folder.
 2. The folder labeled "EasySpark" can be placed inside of the "lib" directory of your repository.
 3. The SparkControllerInfo file can either replace your own (assuming that you don't have any code that requires it), or the contents can be added inside of the file.
